    "Unsupervised learning consists on capturing rich patterns in the data in a label-free approach. This is opposed to the typical supervised learning scheme, in which we have a data set comprised of labeled samples $\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}, y\\right\\}$ and we try to approximate the function $f(x)\\approx y(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {callout-note}\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, even though we follow label-free approaches, what we would consider labels can some times be part of the data corpus.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split deep unsupervised learning in two main categories: generative and self-superivsed learning, although the line is often blurred.\n",
    "In generative learning, we try to recreate the data distribution. This allows us to generate new data points that are likely to belong to the original data set, and often even know the probability to observe them.\n",
    "In self-supervised learning, we instead focus on finding different representations of the data. These are often useful to accomplish other tasks, compress the information, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, in some cases, the resulting models can accomplish downstream tasks without having been trained to perform them explicitly. For example, the generative model [GPT-3](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Abstract.html) is a language model that can perform question answering tasks (among others) without any further specific training for it. Or the self-supervised vision model [DINO](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Caron_Emerging_Properties_in_Self-Supervised_Vision_Transformers_ICCV_2021_paper.html) can extract segmentation masks from images (see @fig-dino or [this video](https://youtu.be/8I1RelnsgMw)).\n",

    "Unsupervised methods have gathered a lot of attention in scientific applications, as they can help us extract physically relevant information from experimental data, as in [this great work](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.010508). Actually, in science, some times we do not even know what to look for in the data! For example, supose that we want to characterize a complex quantum system. To do so, we need to consider all the possible phases the system can be and devise appropiate order parameters to test whether they exist and find the phase transitions. With self-supervised methods, we can find different data representation schemes for specific regions of the phase diagram. This way, we can explore the phase diagram autonomously to find where the phase transitions may be in our system, as shown in [this work](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.170603).\n",

    "Most of the recent advances in the machine learning (ML) field have been mainly due to massive scaling, both in terms of the model size and the amount of data. This has relied heavily in the vast amount of unlabeled data that exists in the internet. Think about it, for every cat image in every appropiately labeled data set we can find, how many unlabeled cat images and videos are in the internet? **The current state-of-the-art practice in many ML applications consists on training an unsupervised model with huge amounts of unlabeled data and, then, leveraging its knowledge to accomplish the desired task**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is akin to the way humans learn. Our brain processes a continuous stream of unlabeled data containing rich information about our environment. Furthermore, we never process the exact same information twice, as there are no two instances of our life that are exactly the same. This allows us to generalize extremely well and make the most out of the relatively scarse labeled data we have access to. For example, given a single [stegosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosaurus) image, we can immediately recognize this dinosaur species anywhere else, with any camera angle, any art-style, and even with partial information (e.g. just a part of the dinosaur).\n",

    "## Generative modeling\n",

    "In this tutorial, we focus on generative learning. As we have briefly mentioned before, it consists on learning the data distribution to generate new samples. This is extremely powerful both on its own, since high-quality new samples can be very valuable, and in combination with other tools to tackle downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many data generation approaches that we can consider. The most straightforward one is to simply generate samples that are similar to the traning ones, such as face images or digits (e.g., [this cat](https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/)). We can also have conditioned synthesis, such as generating an audio signal from a text prompt that can be conditioned to a specific speaker voice (e.g. [WaveNet](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-a-generative-model-for-raw-audio)).\n",
    "This involves all sorts of translation tasks, where we write text from a sample fragment, generate a new image from a reference one (see the emblematic [horse-to-zebra](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Zhu_Unpaired_Image-To-Image_Translation_ICCV_2017_paper.html) example), or even [create a video from a text fragment](https://makeavideo.studio/)!\n",

    "\n",
    "We can communicate very deep concepts with words, but how does a machine *understand* them?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we work with text, we split it into elementary pieces called **tokens**. This is known as tokenization and there is quite a lot of freedom on how to do it. For example, we can take from full sentences, to words, to single characters. The most common practice is to use sub-word tokens that are between single characters to full words, such as [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece). We can also have special tokens to account for additional grammatical information. For example, we can use special tokens to indicate the beggining and ending of a sequence, or to indicate that the words start with capital letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see a simple tokenization example. We would take the following sentence:\n",
    "```\n",
    "My cat won't stop purring.\n",
    "```\n",
    "And transform it into the tokens:\n",
    "```\n",

    "With this, we define a *vocabulary* of tokens. To provide them with \"meaning\", we assign a trainable parameter vector to each of them, which are known as **embedding vectors**. The larger the embedding, the richer the information we can associate to every individual token. We typically store these vectors in a so-called **embedding matrix**, where every row provides the associated embedding vector to a token. This way, we identify the tokens by an integer index that corresponds to their row in the embedding matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking long tokens results into large vocabularies and, therefore, we need more memory. However, we can generate a piece of text with just a few inference steps. Conversely, short tokens require much less memory at the cost of more inference steps to write. Thus, this presents a trade-off between memory and computational time. You can get some intuition about it by comparing the number of letters in the alphabet (shortest possible tokens) with the number of entries in a dictionary (every word is a token).\n",
    "\n",
    "To process a piece of text, we first split it into the tokens of our vocabulary (tokenization), and replace the tokens by their corresponding indices (numericalization). \n",
